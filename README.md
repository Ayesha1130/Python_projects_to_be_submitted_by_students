# Python Projects to be Submitted by Students üöÄ

Welcome to my **Python Projects Repository**! This repository contains 9 Python projects that I completed as part of my learning journey. Each project is designed to enhance problem-solving skills and strengthen Python programming concepts.

## üìå Projects Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Mad Libs Python Project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BlZvZMGmjvopTCicDo7L8WRk0Wnu7Lgj?usp=sharing)
**Description:** A fun word game where users provide random words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), which are then inserted into a pre-defined story template to generate a humorous result.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [Guess the Number Game (Computer)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iKoJx0r6FwLwNZAdzsIwxVywo0kcR_f_?usp=sharing)
**Description:** In this game, the computer attempts to guess a number that the user has in mind. The user provides hints (higher or lower), and the computer narrows down its guesses accordingly.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ [Guess the Number Game (User)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jA0N5Mb9r_xcUQ2FWE6UYGKbyadWHdES?usp=sharing)
**Description:** A classic number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ [Rock, Paper, Scissors Game](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fnulmAbb0c7LHvTgBFSHyXSeTx-GnKqJ?usp=sharing)
**Description:** A Python implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user plays against the computer. The program randomly chooses an option and determines the winner based on standard game rules.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ [Countdown Timer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uln4E1C5U62XhGtot2HaxZImEk-p7lmT?usp=sharing)
**Description:** A simple but effective countdown timer that takes input in seconds and dynamically displays the remaining time. Once the timer reaches zero, it alerts the user.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ [Password Generator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eEOz4zwfqSMcxm2Po8zR_HUYxbk_jVxV?usp=sharing)
**Description:** A secure password generator that creates strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length, inclusion of numbers, special characters, and uppercase letters.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ BMI Calculator Web App (Streamlit)
**Description:** A web-based BMI Calculator built using Streamlit. Users input their height and weight, and the app calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI), categorizing them into different health ranges.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ [Hangman Python Project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HYdiWFKY78Q6KVRRlwObX--TOvzNdzCS?usp=sharing)
**Description:** A classic Hangman game where the user has to guess a hidden word. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn. If the user makes too many incorrect guesses, they lose the game.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ [Build a Python Website in 15 Minutes With Streamlit - Simple Data Dashboard](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ybpMQkqZRGOjfTiqBMtesy7YWZgu_UPS?usp=sharing)
**Description:** A simple data dashboard that allows users to visualize data in various formats like bar charts, line charts, and pie charts. This dashboard takes input data (either CSV or manual entries) and presents it in a visually appealing way using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.
