🚀 Python Projects Repository
This repository contains 8 Python projects that I completed as part of my learning journey. Each project is designed to enhance problem-solving skills and strengthen Python programming concepts.

📌 Projects Overview
1️⃣ Mad Libs Python Project
Description:
A fun word game where users provide random words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), which are then inserted into a pre-defined story template to generate a humorous result.

2️⃣ Guess the Number Game (Computer)
Description:
In this game, the computer attempts to guess a number that the user has in mind. The user provides hints (higher or lower), and the computer narrows down its guesses accordingly.

7️⃣ BMI Calculator Web App (Streamlit)
Description:
A web-based BMI Calculator built using Streamlit. Users input their height and weight, and the app calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI), categorizing them into different health ranges.


8️⃣ Hangman Python Project
Description:
A classic Hangman game where the user has to guess a hidden word. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn. If the user makes too many incorrect guesses, they lose the game.

9️⃣ Build a Python Website in 15 Minutes With Streamlit
Simple Data Dashboard
Description:
A simple data dashboard that allows users to visualize data in various formats like bar charts, line charts, and pie charts. This dashboard takes input data (either CSV or manual entries) and presents it in a visually appealing way using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.
